## 🎯 About This Chaotic Journey

I code whenever I feel like it and honestly, I pretty much spit out **slop**. But hey, sometimes that slop turns into something interesting.

### 🎲 Random Projects

I start projects when inspiration strikes, which is... unpredictable.

### 🎨 Quality Slop

My code might be sloppy, but it's MY slop. And sometimes it works!

### 💝 Pure Passion

No corporate pressure, no deadlines. Just pure, unfiltered coding joy.

Occasionally I'll make use of **GitHub Copilot** and **ChatGPT** to help me out, but most of the time it's just me and my questionable coding practices. When I do use AI, I tend to use it as an aid, not a crutch.

## 🚀 Favourite Slop Projects

### 📂 [Declickbaiter](https://github.com/HBIDamian/Damian-s-AI-Trinkets/tree/main/Declickbaiter)

I got fed up with clickbait titles and articles, so I made this tool to declickbait them. It works... sometimes.

- **Status:** Hanging around... barely
- **Tech:** JavaScript / PHP

### 🎵 [StreamDeckAudioDL-er](https://hbidamian.github.io/StreamDeckAudioDownloader/)

A tool for downloading audio from StreamDeck. Useful to download sound effects for my streams. It works, but it's a bit rough around the edges.

- **Status:** Working
- **Tech:** JavaScript
